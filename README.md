## About The Project

Mama Recipe is a platform designed to provide information about various food recipes to users. Users can upload their own recipes and also like or save recipes from other users. I was fully responsible for the development of the Front-End part of this website. By using Next.js, I successfully created an attractive and responsive interface, allowing users to easily access and interact with the presented food recipe content.
